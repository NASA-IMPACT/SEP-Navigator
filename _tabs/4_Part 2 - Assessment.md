If you have been pointed to this website, you have most likely been chosen to proceed to the Pre-Formulation process. Here is a BRIEF OVERVIEW of the process you just went through.

_The initial SNWG Project Assessment lifecycle. Dates are subject to change each cycle._

****This section needs careful review. What information can be public? This is a good place to integrate the document referred to in SEP meetings that broadly explains the OMB selection process****

### Need Identification
SNWG sends out a survey to U.S. federal agencies to identify their Earth observation needs.

### Need Evaluation
Once received, each submitted survey is assessed by a team of experts from NASA, NOAA, and USGS to determine the scope of the agencyâ€™s need. This evaluation process includes an interview with the submitting agency to follow-up on details about their need provided in the survey response.

### Solution Identification
Based on the needs submitted by the agencies, solutions are identified that would help meet those needs. An emphasis is placed on solutions that would help satisfy multiple agency needs.

### Solution Selection
The proposed solutions are presented to the U.S.Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to be selected for funding. OMB selects the Solutions to fund, then appoints the Implementation teams to form the Project that will develop the Product that will provide the Solution to fulfill the Need. 

### Solution Development
Assessment personnel prioritize the solutions, determine a subset of solutions that will be proposed for funding and estimate the costs associated with each of these solutions.

## Co-design/Co-production in the Assessment Phase
Ya'll need to be talking to us or don't complain when the Product doesn't do what you want.
