> Welcome to the SNWG Project Implementation Guide! This resource will help you understand the SNWG framework and navigate your project's journey from conception to completion.

## Understanding SNWG

The Satellite Needs Working Group (SNWG) conducts a survey of U.S. federal agencies every two years to identify what Earth observation data they need to fulfill their mission. As a project implementation team, you are part of the solution delivery process that turns these identified needs into operational products.

_The SNWG Project lifecycle._

### Project Implementation Context

> Think of your role like translating research into application:
> - Agency needs = research questions
> - Your solution = methodology
> - Implementation = experimental work
> - Stakeholder engagement = peer review
{: .prompt-tip }

Your project exists within a larger framework:
1. Federal agencies identified specific needs through the SNWG survey
2. Experts from NASA, NOAA, and USGS assessed these needs
3. Your solution was selected to address these needs
4. Your team will develop and implement the solution
5. The solution will become an operational product

## Working with the Management Office

_The three core components of the SNWG MO._

The SNWG Management Office will support your project through three key areas:

### 1. Assessment Support
> **What to Expect**: 
> - Access to agency needs assessment
> - Background on solution selection
> - Context for project requirements
> - Stakeholder contact information
{: .prompt-info }

### 2. Implementation Guidance
> **What to Expect**:
> - Project management support
> - Timeline and milestone tracking
> - Open science compliance guidance
> - Resource coordination
{: .prompt-info }

### 3. Stakeholder Engagement
> **What to Expect**:
> - Training and workshop support
> - Stakeholder communication guidance
> - Co-design facilitation
> - Impact documentation

## Project Implementation Lifecycle

Your project will progress through several key phases:
1. Pre-formulation
2. Formulation
3. Implementation
4. Operations
5. Closeout

Each phase has specific requirements and deliverables, which are detailed in the following sections of this guide.

## Essential Resources

As a project implementation team, you'll need to familiarize yourself with:
1. [Stakeholder Engagement Guidelines](/stakeholder-engagement)
2. [Project Implementation Requirements](/project-implementation)
3. [Open Science Protocols](/open-science)
4. [Documentation Templates](/resources)
