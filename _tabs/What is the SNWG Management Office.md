> The Satellite Needs Working Group (SNWG) bridges the gap between Earth observation data providers and federal agencies, ensuring that satellite data effectively serves U.S. government needs.

## At a Glance

The SNWG conducts a survey of U.S. federal agencies every two years to identify what Earth observation data they need to fulfill their mission. This systematic process helps NASA and other agencies understand and address critical data gaps.

## Core Components

### Survey and Assessment
> Think of this like experimental design:
> - The survey is your hypothesis testing
> - Agency needs are your research questions
> - The assessment is your peer review
{: .prompt-tip }

The SNWG process begins with a comprehensive survey of federal agencies to:
- Identify current Earth observation data needs
- Understand gaps in existing data products
- Assess potential improvements to current data offerings

### Analysis and Solution Development
> Like developing a new scientific method:
> - Multiple agencies review the needs (peer review)
> - Solutions are formulated (methodology)
> - Resources are allocated (grant funding)
{: .prompt-tip }

Key steps include:
- Multi-agency assessment (NASA, NOAA, USGS)
- Identification of potential solutions
- Evaluation of technical feasibility
- Resource requirement analysis

### Implementation and Delivery
> Similar to conducting your experiment:
> - Solution development is your data collection
> - Quality checks are your validation
> - Deployment is your publication
{: .prompt-tip }

The final phase involves:
- Development of selected solutions
- Quality assurance and validation
- Deployment to user agencies
- Long-term support and maintenance

## Key Stakeholders

### Data Providers
- NASA Earth Science Division
- NOAA
- USGS
- Other satellite data providers

### Data Users
- Federal agencies with Earth observation needs
- Scientific research community
- Policy makers and decision makers

## Impact

The SNWG has facilitated numerous successful projects that demonstrate the power of collaborative Earth observation solutions:

> ### Success Stories
> - **Air Quality Monitoring**: Enhanced forecasting capabilities
> - **Water Resource Management**: Improved surface water mapping
> - **Land Use Change Detection**: Better tracking of environmental changes
