_Stakeholder Engagement throughout the project lifecycle._

Define Stakeholder:

Who is a primary stakeholder for an SNWG Project?
- Funding sources, OMB, government, DAAC

Who is a stakeholder for the Product produced by the SNWG project? 
- data scientists, requesting agencies
<br>

## Assessment phase
- **Who we talk to:**
A bunch of Federal agencies. They go to another school. You wouldn't know them.

- **What we want to know:**
    - Modify or Enhance: Is there satellite data that already exists that does mostly work for you, but also could be better with some modifications or that exists but doesn't go far enough to actually be useful for you?

        _Example from previous cycles: HLS-VI_

    - Create: Is there satellite data that does not exist, but that you would like to see?

        _Example from previous cycle: Planetary Boundary Layer_

    - Access: Is there satellite data that exists that you need help accessing?

         _Example from previous cycle: Commercial Satellite Data Acquisition_
<br>

## Implementation phase
- **Who we talk to:**
People who submitted surveys in the Assessment phase for the chosen Solution Products.

- **What we want to know:**
This product is getting made. What do you want most to see it do? 

- **How we engage:** 
SPoRT partnership, trainings, workshops

**User Impact Stories during Implementation**
_Internal note: Detail: how do we get impact stories when the Product isn't complete and in use by Federal agencies and private users_

## Operations phase
- Who we talk to
    - People who submitted surveys in the Assessment phase for the chosen Solution Products.
    - Active users of the Operational Product. 

- What we want to know
    - Will you use our product? Please?  
    - If you aren't using it, why not?

- How we engage 
Trainings, workshops, press releases
